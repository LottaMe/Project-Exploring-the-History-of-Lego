- Exploring the History of Lego [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/history-of-lego/guided/Python)
- Data Manipulation with pandas [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas)

## What's the question of the project?

I wouldn't necessarily say the project has one guiding question as much as just exploring the dataset, specifically colors, number of parts & themes. 

In exploring the dataset, a few questions would be: 
- How many different lego colors are there? How many are transparent?
- How has the average number of parts in lego sets changed over the years?
- How many unique themes were shipped each year? + How many unique themes were shipped in 1999?


## Why is this an interesting question?

I would say the most interesting question would be **How has the average number of parts in lego sets changed over the years?** 
It gives an insight into how big lego sets are & whether the trend is upwards or downwards can show what kind of sets (big or small) were produced more.

## What methods are used to answer the question?

- read csv files to a pandas dataframe
- inspecting the first 5 rows of a dataframe
- exploring the shape attribute of a dataframe
- grouping a dataframe by a column
- using methods like: 
  - .count() to count the non-empty values (in column)
  - .mean() to find the mean of numerical values (in column)
  - .nununique() to count the unique values (in column)
  - .plot() to create a (line) plot, vizualising the data
- using .loc to locate a specific piece of data


## What are the most important results?

Focussing again on the question **How has the average number of parts in lego sets changed over the years?**, 
I think it is interesting, that in general the amount of pieces per set went up (except some noise & a few more significant peaks and lows)
and has reached a consistent growth between ~2015 and 2020.

## How do these results answer the question of the study?

That in general, sets with more pieces are being produced more and the trend is currently going upwards.

## Summarize your most important learnings

I think this guided project was less challenging then a lot of the exercises in the course **Data Manipulation with pandas**,
but it was interesting to apply the knowledge from that course without having learned the tools for it just 1 video before.
I had to think more about what I have learned previously and which tool to use when.
